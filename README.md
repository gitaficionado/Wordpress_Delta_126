# Full-Stack Wordpress_Delta_126
Delta126.net is the official digital hub for the alumni and friends of Delta 1/26. The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a centralized communication platform that keeps members informed about reunions, milestone events, and annual updates from leadership.

The project began with a series of informational interviews to understand the operational structure of the Delta 1/26 community. Through this discovery process, I identified three core needs: structured reunion scheduling, formalized leadership communication, and a sustainable archival system for long-term preservation.

From this analysis, I defined a scalable site architecture and implemented structured content types for Events, Leadership Messages (Annual President communications), and News & Updates. Each content type was configured with structured metadata—including event dates, locations, message year, and categories—allowing for chronological sorting and clean archival organization. Additionally, categories and tagging systems were carefully configured to ensure clear separation of content types.

This screen capture demonstrates how I organized the header to include information that would attract a multi-generational audience. I created a top-level navigation system that included a Home, About Us, Calender, Membership, and Photo Gallery, Links, and News page. The gallery was showcased various renunions by the group.

A core functional requirement was the creation of a dynamic event calendar rather than a static event listing. I implemented a structured system that includes custom metadata fields for event date, description, and venue. Events are displayed chronologically, with past events automatically archived to maintain organizational clarity.

An administrative workflow was built to allow board members to publish and edit events independently, minimizing long-term technical dependency. The calendar functions as an operational tool for reunion planning and directly supports the association’s primary objective of keeping members informed of upcoming activities. This feature directly supports the association’s primary business objective: keeping members informed of upcoming reunions and activities. 

I also wanted to strengthen transparency and preserve institutional history. So, I developed a structured archive for annual President messages. Messages are organized by year, formatted for long-form readability, and displayed using consistent templates to preserve visual continuity. The backend interface was simplified to ensure annual updates can be published without developer assistance. This feature enhances credibility and fosters transparency within the membership community

This screen capture demonstrates how I addressed the organization’s need for transparency by creating a dedicated section for the President’s message. The page ensures that annual leadership communications are easily accessible to all members and presented in a clear, readable format directly within the site.

A key project requirement was minimizing ongoing technical oversight. To achieve this, I simplified the WordPress dashboard experience, reduced unnecessary plugin usage, configured role-based permissions, and designed structured content-entry templates for non-technical administrators. The result is a maintainable system that empowers board members to manage updates independently while preserving structural integrity and performance standards.

This screen cpature reflects the easy of use for others to maintain. The page also has a survey that I formatted for users to show interest in attending a Delta 1/26 event in the future.

This project demonstrates full-lifecycle WordPress development capability—from discovery and content modeling to theme customization and backend workflow optimization. It reflects my ability to translate organizational requirements into structured CMS architecture, implement scalable content systems, design intuitive navigation for legacy audiences, and deliver maintainable platforms that empower non-technical stakeholders.
