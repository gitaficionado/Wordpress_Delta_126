# Full-Stack Wordpress_Delta_126
Delta126.net is the official digital hub for the alumni and friends of Delta 126. The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a centralized communication platform that keeps members informed about reunions, milestone events, and annual updates from leadership. 

Based on feedback from thd Delta 1/26 team, I was able to create a comprehensive website for Delta Company 1/26 Marines RVN Association to serve as a centralized communication platform for alumni, leadership updates, and reunion coordination.

I completed a comprehensive analysis of Delta 1/26 community with informational interviews and organizational analysis. I evaluated the association’s operational needs to define a scalable site structure. This included reunion scheduling, leadership communication, and long-term archival requirements. My first task was to create types for:

* **Events** (Reunions, Meetings, Special Gatherings)
* **Leadership Messages** (Annual President communications)
* **News & Updates**

Each content type included structured metadata (event dates, locations, message year, categories), enabling chronological display and archival organization. Then, I configured categories and tagging systems to separate leadership updates from event content and general announcements, ensuring scalable growth over time.

This screen capture demonstrates how I organized the header to include information that would attract a multi-generational audience.

I also wanted to create a calender for the Delta 1/26 community. The calendar functionality was implemented as a structured, dynamic system rather than a static listing:

* Configured event metadata fields for date, description, and venue.
* Enabled chronological sorting and automatic archival of past events.
* Built an administrative workflow allowing board members to publish and edit events independently.
* Ensured the calendar functioned as an operational tool for reunion planning.

This feature directly supports the association’s primary business objective: keeping members informed of upcoming reunions and activities. I also created a structured archive for annual President messages:

* Year-based organizational structure.
* Clean, long-form content formatting optimized for readability.
* Consistent templating to preserve visual continuity across years.
* Easily maintainable backend interface for annual updates.

This screen capture demonstrates how I incorporated the needs of Delta 1/26 by supporting the group's President's message for all to view. This compoent increased credibility and transparency amongst memebrs.

This section preserves institutional history while strengthening community continuity.





Implemented a clear top-level navigation system:

* Home
* About Us
* Calendar
* Membership
* Photo Gallery
* Links
* News





* Structured photo gallery integration for reunion imagery.
* Optimized images for performance without sacrificing clarity.
* Ensured consistent layout styling across posts and pages.
* Applied brand-aligned color schemes reflecting Marine Corps identity.



## Administrative Usability & Sustainability

A key requirement was minimizing technical dependency. To achieve this:

* Simplified the WordPress dashboard experience.
* Reduced plugin bloat.
* Configured role-based permissions.
* Designed content entry templates for non-technical administrators.

This screen capture reflects the simplicity of site as requested by the Delta 1/26 team. The result is a system that remains maintainable without ongoing developer oversight.

The site demonstrates strong WordPress theming and front-end customization:

* Theme template modifications for structured layout control.
* Custom CSS for brand-aligned styling and high-contrast readability.
* Consistent visual hierarchy across content types.
* Responsive layout foundation for cross-device accessibility.


The project highlights structured data implementation within WordPress:

* Dynamic event listings based on metadata.
* Automated chronological ordering.
* Archive logic for historical messages and events.
* Sidebar widget configuration for recent posts and calendar visibility.


The Delta126.net platform now serves as:

* The authoritative calendar for Delta 126 reunions.
* A permanent archive of annual President communications.
* A centralized hub for alumni engagement.
* A sustainable content system for long-term organizational continuity.

The Delta126.net project demonstrates full-lifecycle WordPress development capability — from discovery and content modeling to theme customization and backend workflow optimization.

It validates my ability to:

* Translate organizational requirements into structured CMS architecture.
* Implement scalable custom content systems.
* Build intuitive navigation for legacy audiences.
* Create maintainable platforms that empower non-technical stakeholders.
* Deliver a cohesive, branded user experience within WordPress.

The architecture reflects how the organization operates in reality, reducing friction for a multi-generational audience.
